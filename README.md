## Features
Smart Resume Screening allows users to upload resumes and get intelligent insights using AI. It performs resume parsing, content analysis, and relevance scoring to help identify suitable candidates faster. The application offers a clean and responsive user interface, secure authentication, and seamless integration between frontend and backend services.

## Tech Stack
The project is built using modern web technologies. The frontend is developed with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB used for database management. Firebase is used for authentication and additional services. Cohere AI is integrated to provide intelligent resume analysis and screening capabilities.

## How It Works
Users upload resumes through the web interface. The backend processes the resume data, extracts meaningful information, and sends it to the AI model for analysis. Based on the content and relevance, the system generates structured insights that help recruiters make informed decisions.

## Installation and Setup
To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies for both frontend and backend. Configure environment variables for database connections, Firebase, and Cohere AI keys. Start the backend server and then run the frontend development server.

## Project Status
